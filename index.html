        <h4>"We Watch" - a mobile prototype project</h4>
        <p>Our motivation for building this app is to create a social catalog for film and TV consumption that is an amalgamation of available content across multiple streaming and subscription platforms. Our app will make it easier to connect with people by allowing users to share and compare their cultivated lists of media.</p>

        <h4>Department of Homeland Security Webpage Redesign</h4>
        <p>Built a meaningful and improved user interface from a brand voice for a government agency website.</p>
        <br>
        <p2>The Dept of Homeland Securityâ€™s website was cluttered and disorganized. The experience was very one-dimensional and frustrating. Users struggled to even find basic contact information. To solve this, I planned to reorganize the site map and develop an improved content organization, with the goal of making the visual design more modern, visually stimulating, and easier to navigate.</p2>

        <p>Project Transitions is a non-profit organization in Austin, TX that benefits indigent and low-income patients suffering from HIV and AIDS. A responsive redesign of this website will allow all of its potential users to understand the content and easily meet their needs on whatever device they have access to. We also aim to make the mission of the organization clearer to visitors. A redesign will bolster the efforts of the organization through increased reach and engagement.</p>
